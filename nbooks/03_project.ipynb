    "Student provides a high-level overview of the project. Background information such as the problem domain, the project origin, and related data sets or input data is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Investment firms, hedge funds and even individuals have been using financial models to better understand market behavior and make profitable investments and trades. A wealth of information is available in the form of historical stock prices and company performance data, suitable for machine learning algorithms to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I build a stock price predictor that takes daily trading data over a certain date range as input, and outputs projected estimates for given query dates. Inputs contain multiple metrics:\n",
    " * opening price (Open)\n",
    " * highest price the stock traded at (High)\n",
    " * how many stocks were traded (Volume)\n",
    "Whereas the prediction is made on:\n",
    " * closing price adjusted for stock splits and dividends (Adjusted Close)\n",

    "We want to explore, where possible, S&P500 companies. The list of the listed companies is taken from [here](https://datahub.io/core/s-and-p-500-companies). \n",
    "The trading data comes from [Quandl End-of-Day US stock prices](https://www.quandl.com/data/EOD-End-of-Day-US-Stock-Prices) and it is downloaded through their [API](https://www.quandl.com/data/EOD-End-of-Day-US-Stock-Prices/usage/quickstart/api) and stored locally. Details are provided into the `Data Exploration` section below.\n",
